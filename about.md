I am a dog named Sesame.  I was adopted by two loving people who live in a really big house. I also have a roommate who's quite rambunctious... Her name is Quinoa. (Maybe I shouldn't say that about her-- but it's true. She can't read though.) Yes, I know, you're probably wondering how I can type.  Well it's none of your business now is it? 

I write about my day-to-day life in this house.  I don't like the rain or getting wet.  I enjoy sleeping in and laying in my favorite bed.  My parents are very nice to me and I wouldn't know what to do without them.  I secretly(?) enjoy eating trash.  I usually blame it on Quinoa if there's a mess in the house- well because it's usually her anyways.  Add me on WeChat!
