Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite <a href="http://reddit.com" target="blank">subreddit</a>. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture "Ses.jpg" and put it in the img folder. 

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="blank">Font Awesome icons</a>, like the ones below. Add your facebook, twitter, linkedin, or just disable all of them.
